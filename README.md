# FinalThesis
A PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR BOOKINGS IN FOOTBALL EVENTS
Final Thesis code including:
- Data Extraction
- Feature modelling
- Data Visualisation
- Principal Component Analysis

Then the data was processed into a generalized linear mixed model using SPSS.

Final conclusion is that the dataset suffers from omitted variables bias that could not be surpassed ==> more features are needed to be able to predict booking events.

The code here nonetheless will be extremely useful in extracting the dataset + constructing a set of approx. 20 features.
